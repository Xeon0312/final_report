\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we develop two models with the purpose of forecasting how
the 2019 Canadian Federal Election would have been different if
`everyone' had voted. Multilevel regression with postratification (MRP)
and Stacked regression with postratification models where constructed
using the 2019 Canadian Election Study survey and postsratified using
the 2016 Canadian Education Highlight Tables census dataset. We
concluded that if ``everyone'' votes, there is a high probability that
there is no obvious difference

\section{1 Introduction}\label{introduction}}

The 2019 Canadian federal election (formally the 43rd Canadian general
election) was held on October 21, 2019, to elect members of the House of
Commons to the 43rd Canadian Parliament. The Liberal Party, led by
incumbent Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, won 157 seats to form a
minority government and lost the majority they had won in the 2015
election. The Liberals lost the popular vote to the Conservatives, which
marks only the second time in Canadian history that a governing party
formed a government while receiving less than 35 per cent of the
national popular vote.The Conservative Party, led by Andrew Scheer, won
121 seats and remained the Official Opposition. The Bloc Québécois,
under Yves-François Blanchet, won 32 seats to regain official party
status and became the third party for the first time since 2008. The New
Democratic Party, led by Jagmeet Singh, won 24 seats, its worst result
since 2004. The Green Party, led by Elizabeth May, saw its best election
results with three seats and for the first time received over one
million votes.

However, the gap between the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party is
not very large. When voters vote, they may be affected by other
conditions that may cause some voters to absent or abstain. The final
result may still be somewhat different from the real public opinion.
This time, we use multilevel regression with postratification (MRP) and
Stacked regression with postratification models to simulate the answer
if `everyone' had voted. For the data part, we are going to use 2019
Canadian Election Study survey and postsratified using the 2016 Canadian
Education Highlight census dataset. Details will be in the Model
section.

After a series of simulation experiments, we found that although the
proportion of votes among the parties has changed, the overall result is
the same as before. The Liberal Party is still elected by a narrow
margin. This reflects that the public opinion of Canadian voters has
been truly reflected and has not been affected by other factors.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{report_files/figure-latex/makeGraph1-1} \caption{Party Voted in CES2019 survey}\label{fig:makeGraph1}
\end{figure}

As can be seen, The Liberal Party and the Conservative Party are the two
most mainstream parties with support ratings of 34\% and 33\%
respectively. NDP and Green Party ranked third and fourth with 16\% and
9\% respectively

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{report_files/figure-latex/makeGraph2-1} \caption{How Respondents Plan to Vote in 2019 By Gender}\label{fig:makeGraph2}
\end{figure}

It can be seen from the figure that the proportion of men and women in
the voting population is similar, with slightly more women. Women
accounted for the majority of votes obtained by NDP.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{report_files/figure-latex/makeGraph3-1} \caption{How Respondents Plan to Vote in 2019 By Province}\label{fig:makeGraph3}
\end{figure}

It can be concluded from the figure that the proportion of people in
Ontario who voted is higher. Interestingly, the votes of the Bloc
Quebecois party only come from Quebec.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{report_files/figure-latex/makeGraph4-1} \caption{How Respondents Plan to Vote in 2019 By education}\label{fig:makeGraph4}
\end{figure}

The data obtained from the graph shows that most of the voting
population has higher education than high school. Those who voted for
the Conservative Party had an average education level higher than those
who voted for the Liberal Party.

\hypertarget{gss-data}{%
\subsection{GSS Data}\label{gss-data}}

The dataset we used for our analysis came from responses to the ``2017
General Social Survey (GSS): Families Cycle 31''. The 2017 GSS,
conducted from February 2nd to November 30th, 2017, is a sample survey
with a cross-sectional design. The target population includes all
non-institutionalized persons 15 years of age and older, living in the
10 provinces of Canada. The survey uses a new frame, created in 2013,
that combines telephone numbers (landline and cellular) with Statistics
Canada's Address Register, and collects data via telephone. Data are
subject to both sampling and non-sampling errors. Each record in the
survey frame was assigned to a stratum within its province. A simple
random sample without replacement of records was next performed in each
stratum. The target sample size (i.e.~the desired number of respondents)
for the 2017 GSS was 20,000 while the actual number of respondents was
20,602. The survey frame was created using two different components: 1.
Lists of telephone numbers in use (both landline and cellular) available
to Statistics Canada from various sources (telephone companies, Census
of population, etc.); 2. The Address Register (AR): List of all
dwellings within the ten provinces. The overall response rate for the
2017 GSS was 52.4\%.

The target population for the 2017 GSS included all persons 15 years of
age and older in Canada, excluding: 1. Residents of the Yukon, Northwest
Territories, and Nunavut; and 2. Full-time residents of institutions.
That will cause some data missing.
